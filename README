NAME

    Inline::PERL - Bring the power of PERL programming to your Perl
    programs.


================================================================================
SYNOPSIS

        use Inline::Files;
        use Inline PERL;

        greeting("PERL");

        __PERL__
        sub greeting {

            $foo = shift @_ || $_[0];

            $! = 1; # Turn buffering off

            for ($i=1, $i<=10, $i++) {
                @a[$i] = $i;
            }

            local $length = @a.length;

            print "Hello, $foo\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION

    Inline::PERL gives you the power of the PERL programming language from
    within your Perl programs. This gives you instant access to hundreds of
    pre-coded applications such as bulletin boards, hit counters and
    shopping carts.

    PERL is a programming language for writing CGI applications. It's main
    strength is that it doesn't have any unnecessary warnings or strictures.
    It is a direct descendent of Perl, a programming language which was used
    mainly by programmers. However, the original language required too much
    reading and thinking and so PERL was developed as a language which was
    more in tune with the requirements of the Internet age.

    This module is not meant to be serious. If you are interested in
    writing a genuine Inline add-in you should have a look at the Inline-API
    documentation and the Foo.pm example that come with Inline.


================================================================================
INSTALLATION

    This module does work and it will allow you to include PERL code in
    your Perl program. To install this module you can follow the usual
    procedure with the exception that you should use Makefile.PERL instead
    of Makefile.PL.

        perl Makefile.PERL # Note!!
        make
        make test
        make install
